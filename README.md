What is Git?
Git is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

What Is GitHub? GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

What Is Version Control? Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress… At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code. Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.

Repository: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. When you create a repository, you can choose to make the repository public or private. Repositories in organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud and are owned by an enterprise account can also be created with internal visibility.

How are softwares are using github? Git is used to tracking changes in the source code. The distributed version control tool is used for source code management. It allows multiple developers to work together. It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches.
# python-assignment-
In this assignment we are going to find the,
1.to print pattern of 5 numbers in a right angled triangled form
for this, we just know the concept of loops like for, by using for loop we can solve this problem easily.
2.Multiplying of two numbers
for this we need to give two numbers as a input, and we know how to do multiplication process so just code it.
3.reverse of a string
if we give a string as a input by using reverse built in function we can get the reverse of a string.
4.Addition of two numbers
like as multiplication process, we have same process to addition.
5.Armstrong of a given number
We know that, armstrong number means sum of cubes of digits in a given number then we get same number therefore we should called it as armstrong number. for example 153=1^3+5^+3^3=153.
6.Fibnacci series
Intially, take 0,1 as a input and by using own process like by taking temporary variable in which we have store the temporary variables.
7.Leap year
we know that leap year is the year which is divisible by 4 and get the remainder as 0 then we called that year as a leap year.
8.Largest of a given number
we can give a list of numbers as a input. And we get the output as the largest number among the given list.
9.Removing ith character from a given string
if we want to remove a specified character in a given string .In that case we should use this one.
10.sorting of a given list
we know ,what is sorting? It is an arrangement of a given list either in an ascending or descending order, we can done this by using sort() built in function.
